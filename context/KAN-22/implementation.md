# Implementation Documentation - KAN-22

## Initial Implementation

### Files Created/Modified

1. **infrastructure/lambda/readings/generate-reading.ts**
   - Added `createErrorResponse` helper function (lines 13-36)
   - Modified error handling to use generic messages (lines 380-406)
   - Maintained detailed CloudWatch logging with console.error

2. **infrastructure/test/readings.test.ts**
   - Added 7 new test cases for error scenarios (6 active, 1 skipped)
   - Test coverage for network timeouts, auth failures, rate limits, SSM failures
   - Verification of generic error messages and CloudWatch logging

### Key Changes

- Implemented centralized error handling with `createErrorResponse` function
- All errors now return generic message: "We're sorry, but we couldn't generate your reading at this time. Please try again later."
- Full error details logged to CloudWatch with stack traces
- DynamoDB stores sanitized error indicator ('GENERATION_FAILED')
- S3 prompt failures fall back to hardcoded prompts silently

### Verification Results

- All 15 active tests passing
- TypeScript compilation successful
- ESLint checks passing
- Frontend and infrastructure builds successful

## Fix Round 1

### Review Status

The code review identified the implementation as APPROVED with two minor issues to fix.

### Issues Addressed

#### FIX-1: Frontend Error Display

**File:** `/home/gabriel/myProjects/aura28cdk/frontend/app/dashboard/readings-tab.tsx`
**Line:** 148
**Change:** Updated error display to always show a consistent generic message instead of potentially exposing the sanitized error indicator.

- Before: `<p>Failed to generate reading: {selectedReading.error || 'Unknown error'}</p>`
- After: `<p>We&apos;re sorry, but we couldn&apos;t generate your reading at this time. Please try again later.</p>`

#### FIX-2: API Error Response Handling

**File:** `/home/gabriel/myProjects/aura28cdk/frontend/lib/api/user-api.ts`
**Lines:** 290-291
**Change:** Updated error extraction to handle both `message` and `error` response formats for consistency with Lambda responses.

- Before: `throw new Error(error.error || 'Failed to generate reading');`
- After: `throw new Error(data.message || data.error || 'Failed to generate reading');`

### Verification

After applying fixes:

- ✅ Code formatting with Prettier passed
- ✅ ESLint checks passed (after fixing React unescaped entities)
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ All tests passing (frontend and infrastructure)
- ✅ Build successful for both frontend and infrastructure

### Notes

- Applied HTML entity encoding (`&apos;`) for apostrophes in React components to satisfy ESLint
- Both fixes were minor and cosmetic, not affecting core functionality
- All existing functionality preserved while improving consistency
