# Git Workflow Guide

## Pre-Commit Checklist

**IMPORTANT**: Before pushing any changes to GitHub, you MUST complete ALL of the following steps IN THIS EXACT ORDER:

**‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING**: The order of these steps is CRITICAL. Running them out of order will cause CI/CD failures!

### 1. Run linting

```bash
npm run lint  # (at root level)
```

- Catches potential code quality issues early
- Ensures TypeScript and ESLint rules are satisfied
- Run this FIRST to catch issues before other checks

### 2. Run tests

```bash
npm test  # (at root level)
```

- Verifies all tests pass
- Prevents breaking existing functionality
- **Important**: Also run `npm run test:frontend` and `npm run test:infrastructure` separately to ensure test output is clearly visible

### 3. Build check (CRITICAL: Must come BEFORE formatting!)

```bash
npm run build  # (at root level)
```

- Ensures the project builds successfully
- Catches TypeScript compilation errors
- **CRITICAL**: This generates `.d.ts` declaration files that MUST be formatted
- **MUST run BEFORE formatting** to ensure generated files exist

### 4. Run formatting

```bash
npm run format  # (at root level)
```

- Formats all code including newly generated `.d.ts` files from the build
- Ensures consistent code style
- **MUST run AFTER build** to format generated declaration files

### 5. Verify formatting (NEW - CRITICAL STEP!)

```bash
npm run format:check  # (at root level)
```

Then also verify from infrastructure directory:

```bash
cd infrastructure && npm run format:check
```

- **CRITICAL**: Both commands must show "All matched files use Prettier code style!"
- CI/CD runs format:check from the infrastructure directory separately
- If either fails, run `npm run format` again and re-check
- This step prevents CI/CD formatting failures

### 6. Verify no untracked files

```bash
git status
```

- Ensure all necessary files are staged (including formatted `.d.ts` files)
- Check for any accidentally modified files
- Look for any generated files that need to be committed

### 7. Review changes

```bash
git diff --staged
```

- Double-check your changes are intentional
- Look for any debug code or temporary changes
- Verify all formatted files are included

### 8. Stage and commit changes

```bash
git add .  # Stage all changes (or use specific file paths)
git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message

ü§ñ Generated with Claude Code (https://claude.ai/code)

Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>"
```

- **IMPORTANT**: Always include a descriptive commit message
- Include Claude Code attribution in commit messages when using Claude Code
- Husky pre-commit hooks will automatically run linting and formatting
- If pre-commit hooks fail, fix the issues and try again

### 9. Push to remote repository

```bash
git push origin develop  # Push to develop branch
```

- **CRITICAL**: This step triggers GitHub Actions workflows
- Always verify the push succeeded with `git status`
- Check GitHub Actions tab to monitor workflow execution
- If push is rejected, pull latest changes first: `git pull origin develop --rebase`

## Why This Order Matters

The build step (step 3) generates TypeScript declaration files (`.d.ts`). These files MUST exist before formatting (step 4) can format them. If you format before building, the CI/CD pipeline will fail because it will find unformatted declaration files.

**Note on Steps 8-9**: Commit and push are now explicit steps to ensure changes are actually pushed to GitHub and workflows are triggered. Previously, these were implicit, which could lead to commits being made locally but not pushed to the remote repository.

For detailed explanation, see the "Pre-Commit Checklist" section in CLAUDE.md.

## Git Workflow Rules

**CRITICAL**: These rules MUST be followed at all times:

### Branch Management

- **NEVER push directly to main branch**
- **ALWAYS work in the develop branch** unless explicitly instructed otherwise
- **Production deployments** only happen via merging develop ‚Üí main
- **Default branch**: Always use `develop` for all changes

### Commit Workflow

1. Make changes in develop branch
2. Run pre-commit checklist (all 9 steps above IN ORDER)
3. Only merge to main when explicitly requested by user

### Quick Reference Commands

```bash
# Switch to develop branch
git checkout develop

# Check current branch
git branch

# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit with message
git commit -m "Your commit message"

# Push to develop
git push origin develop
```

## Common CI/CD Failures and Solutions

### Format Check Failure in Infrastructure

**Error**: `Code style issues found in X files. Run Prettier with --write to fix.`

**Cause**: Declaration files (`.d.ts`) were not formatted after build.

**Solution**:

1. Run `npm run build` at root
2. Run `npm run format` at root
3. Run `npm run format:check` at root AND `cd infrastructure && npm run format:check`
4. Commit the formatted `.d.ts` files

**Remember**: Following this workflow ensures code quality, prevents CI/CD failures, and maintains a stable production environment.
